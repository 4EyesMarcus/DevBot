# DevBot

This bot is going to be primarily for moderation with youtube music commands. This bot will be able to read from a file a list of words which in turn
be able to delete the user's message and warn/ban (depending on word ofc) user. This is my first attempt at python for a discord bot so please be gentle
and dont judge too harshley please :3
